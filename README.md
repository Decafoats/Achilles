# 🥅 Objective: 

We want to deliver a product to assist the general public in analyzing their feet health. 

# 🌎 Overview:

For our final project for ENSE 400, we want to propose an automated foot analysis system. We will implement the project through a cross-platform mobile app. Within the app, an AI system developed in Java will determine the attributes of the foot. Users can photograph their feet and fill out a short questionnaire within the app. Then the AI will use the information gathered and compare it to a database to determine the root cause of the pain as well as suggest mediation methods. 

# 🤔 Reasoning:

The reasoning for this project is that foot health is essential, and the average person doesn't know how to diagnose their symptoms. A person might experience foot pain, mild or acute, and might shrug it off because they cannot be bothered to reach out to a specialist. Even though there are simple solutions such as "stop buying shoes that are too small" or "decrease your running frequency,". Or, they can have serious problems such as diabetes and is in dire need of a consultation with a doctor immediately. Taking care of your feet early in the symptoms is crucial as some issues can have irreversible effects, and we hope our project will assist users in those regards.
